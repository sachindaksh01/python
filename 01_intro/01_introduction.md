# Introduction to programming Language

Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. The computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence we learn to program and tell computers to do what we are very slow at - computation. If I ask you to calculate 5+6, you will immediately say 11. How about 23453453 X 56456?.

## What is an Interpreter?

Â· An interpreter is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code.

## What is Python?
-   Python is a dynamically typed, general purpose programming language that supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach.
-   Python is an interpreted and a high-level programming language.
-   It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989.


  
## Features of Python

-   Python is simple and easy to understand.
-   It is Interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.
-   Python is an open-source programming language.
-   Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include NumPy, Tensorflow, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.
-   It is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.

## What is Python used for

-   Python is used in Data Visualization to create plots and graphical representations.
-   Python helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.
-   It is used in AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard coding.
-   It is used to create web applications.
-   It can be used to handle databases.
-   It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical operations along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.
