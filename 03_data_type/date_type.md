# Python Data Types

+ In programming, data type is an important concept.
+ Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
+ Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

```python
Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	NoneType

```

## Getting the Data Type
You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:
### Example : 
```python
x = 5
print(type(x))
```
### Output
```
 int

```
