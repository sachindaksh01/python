# Python - Slicing Strings

+ You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.
+ Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string


### Example
Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included):

```python
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])
```
### Output 
```
llo
```

> [!NOTE]
>  The first character has index 0.
